My favorite game is football.
This game has two teams usually have between 11 and 18 players,and who try to maneuver the ball into the other team's goal without using their hands or arms.
Football ground should be about 100 to 110 meters in length and about 64 to 75 meters wide.
I also like to play cricket,in my free time and in this game we play with a ball and bat by two sides of usually 11 players each on a large field centering upon two wickets each defended by a batsman
The radius of the cricket ground should be a minimum of 130 meters from the boundary to the boundary squares of the pitch.
